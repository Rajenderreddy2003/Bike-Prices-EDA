This project involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing information about used bikes scraped from the **BikesWale** website. The goal is to uncover insights into factors that influence bike prices such as engine capacity, mileage, brand, and more.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset includes the following columns:
- **Brand**: Bike manufacturer (e.g., Royal Enfield, Yamaha)
- **Model_Name**: Full model name
- **CC**: Engine displacement in cubic centimeters
- **BHP**: Brake Horse Power
- **Mileage**: Mileage offered (kmpl)
- **Price**: On-road price in INR
- **Type**: Fuel type (e.g., Petrol)
- **Weight**: Weight of the bike in kg
- **Rating**: User rating

## 🔍 EDA Workflow

The notebook covers:
1. **Dataset Overview**
2. **Missing Values & Duplicates**
3. **Data Cleaning** (e.g., converting Price to numeric)
4. **Univariate Analysis** (Distribution plots)
5. **Bivariate Analysis** (Scatter plots, box plots)
6. **Multivariate Analysis** (Pairplots, correlation heatmap)
7. **Key Insights & Conclusion**

## 📊 Tools & Libraries

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Plotly (optional for interactive plots)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Key Insights

- Brand and engine capacity significantly affect bike price.
- Higher CC bikes generally cost more.
- Royal Enfield models tend to retain higher resale value.
- Some features like weight or mileage have less impact on price.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook
2. Open `Bike_Prices_EDA_Project.ipynb` in Jupyter
3. Run all cells to see the complete analysis
